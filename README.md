## ðŸ’¿ Install step by step 
1. node -v
2. npm install -g
3. yarn install or npm install


Set up your project using your preferred package manager. Use the corresponding command to install the dependencies:

| Package Manager                                                | Command        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)                   | `yarn install` |
| [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install)     | `npm install`  |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)                          | `pnpm install` |
| [bun](https://bun.sh/#getting-started)                        | `bun install`  |

After completing the installation, your environment is ready for Vuetify development.


## ðŸ’¡ Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server
### Important for local project run 
1. yarn dev or npm run dev

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production
### Important
1. yarn build or npm run build     


To build your project for production, use:
```bash
yarn build
```
(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)
Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
